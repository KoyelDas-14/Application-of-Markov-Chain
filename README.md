# Application-of-Markov-Chain
With the increasing number of G3M2 virus cases in the country, two vaccine manufactur-
ers in the country have quickly developed two different single-vial vaccines. These vaccines need to be stored in a temperature-controlled case, and an
agency has been entrusted with the responsibility of administering the vaccines to the inter-
ested public. 

Considering that the vaccines have been developed within a very short time,there are very few takers for the vaccine worrying about the potential side-effects. Due to
limited availability, an agency of a particular vaccine manufacturer is permitted to store only
four vaccines.The number of vials administered during a day by an agency is a random
variable with a discrete distribution.

If the agency has no vaccines in stock at the end of the day, the agency contacts its supplier
to order four more vaccines. The vaccines are delivered the following morning before the
agency opens.

Since number of vaccines at the time of opening on nth day will depend on the previous day only and not on the days before, we can use Markov Chain properties to get the outcome.
